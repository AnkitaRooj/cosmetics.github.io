                          <p class="card-text">So that your foundation and, therefore your makeup, doesn't budge, make sure your skin is squeaky clean and well-moisturised. Start with a deep cleanse: micellar water, cleansing lotion, oil, milk or gel - just make sure you choose one that suits your skin type. Follow with a face scrub to remove dead cells and instantly leave you with glowing skin. Finish your cleansing routine with a mattifying moisturiser. Apply your foundation The idea is to use a small amount for a natural look. Leave it to dry for a few minutes and then lightly dust on a loose powder to fix your foundation - this will prevent it from evaporating as the night goes on, leaving you with a velvety rather than shiny complexion.  Added tip: apply a primer that will Photoshop out any blemishes and help your makeup stick. Finally, apply a spritz of fixing mist, as this will hydrate your skin whilst keeping your makeup in place.</p>
